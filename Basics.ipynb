    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to contribute to the development of a mobile app by writing a couple of functions that are mostly focused on calculating probabilities. This app is aimed to prevent and treat lottery addiction by helping people better estimate their chances of winning.\n",

    "The app idea comes from a medical institute which is specialized in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that can answers users the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big price with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five(or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
